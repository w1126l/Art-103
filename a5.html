        <h5>Questions</h5>

        <br>

        <h6>1. What are the differences between Site Specific art work and the idea of Art Interventions.</h6>
        <p1><i>Site Specific art is relevant to the environment it is in and exist in a specific place for a specific reason.
        The idea of Art Intervention is based off of an interaction and can be more spontaneous and random but produces something that originates more from the artist than the environment.</i></p1>

        <br><br>

        <h6>2. Choose 2 of the 4 artists shared and answer the following for each artist..</h6>
        <h7>A. Take one or more of the art works from the listed artists and please describe how a piece(s) function as site specific work or an intervention. Please provide context and examples to explain your answer.</h7>
        <br><br><h7>B. For the same piece(s), explain your interpretation of the work. What does it mean to you?</h7>
        <br><br>

            <p>Hayat Nazer</p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p1><i>
          This piece is a site specific art. It acknowledges a tragedy that had happened in the same area that this piece was created.
          I personally thought this was a powerful piece, especially because the artist took pieces of furniture from different broken homes to create a collaborative memorial.

        </div>
        <br>
        <p1><i>
          Dismaland is an art intervention aimed to be a pessimistic view on Disneyland and perhaps other places that are supposed to be "a happy place."
          Since Disneyland is all over the world, it doesn't seem like a site specific artwork because Dismaland can be placed anywhere.
        </i></p1>

        <br><br>

        <h6>3. What is the single most important that all signs must share to be relevant and effective? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home. This is NOT about aesthetics or constuction, but just functionality of the idea.</h6>
        <p1><i>
          I think the most important thing about signs is its ability to convey the message needed in any way possible.
        </i></p1>

        <br><br>

        <h6>4. What kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide 1 image for reference.</h6>

        <p>John Garth (1889 - 1971)</p>
        <br>
        <p1><i>
          These two mosaics have been part of Millbrae's Safeway for as long as I have been living in Millbrae.
          From online databases and websites about Garth, these mosaics depicts life in the years in the mosaic.
          These panels were originally installed in the old Millbrae Safeway.
          The Millbrae Safeway was part of the wave of "Marina style" Safeways with arched entrances and exterior walls of rocks.
          In 2013, the Millbrae Safeway in the Marina style was torn down and replaced with a two-story "lifestyle format".
          However, Safeway decided to keep these mosaics and they currently face El Camino Real installed on the side of the Millbrae Safeway.
